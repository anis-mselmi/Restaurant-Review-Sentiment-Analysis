# 🍕 Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis (Google Colab Project)

This project is an **AI model built in Google Colab** that analyzes restaurant reviews  
and classifies them as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** using a Deep Learning model (LSTM).  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Input: A restaurant review (e.g., *"The tacos were amazing!"* 🌮)  
- Output: Sentiment → `Positive`, `Negative`, or `Neutral`  
- Frameworks: **TensorFlow/Keras**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Preprocess restaurant reviews (tokenization, padding, label encoding)
- Train a Deep Learning **LSTM** model
- Visualize accuracy and loss curves
- Test the model on **custom reviews**
- Easily extendable with a larger dataset (e.g., Yelp, TripAdvisor)

---

## 🚀 How to Run in Google Colab
1. Open **Google Colab**: [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)  
2. Create a new notebook.  
3. Copy-paste the provided notebook cells (from this repo).  
4. Run the cells step by step.  
5. Try predictions by adding your own reviews in the **custom review section**.
